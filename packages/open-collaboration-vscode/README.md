# Open Collaboration Tools

Open Collaboration Tools is a collection of open source tools, libraries and extensions for live-sharing of IDE contents, designed to boost remote teamwork with open technologies.

This is how it works: one person starts a collaboration session as host and invites others to join. The IDE extension distributes the contents of the host ºs workspace and highlights text selections and cursor positions of other participants. In parallel, they get together in their favorite meeting or chat app for immediate discussion. All participants see what the others are looking at and and what changes they propose in real-time. This way of remote collaboration reduces confusion and maximizes productivity.

What's special about Open Collaboration Tools is that it's fully open source under the MIT license, and that it offers libraries to extend the approach on multiple levels: custom editors, custom IDE integrations, or even web applications.

For more information about this project, please [read the announcement](https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/).

## Server Configuration

This extension needs a server instance to which all participants of a collaboration session connect. The server URL is configured with the setting `oct.serverUrl`. Its default is set to `https://api.open-collab.tools/`, which is a public instance operated by [TypeFox](https://www.typefox.io/). TypeFox offers this service with the intent to demonstrate the capabilities of the project and to support open source communities with it. However, we recommend all companies who wish to adopt this technology to deploy their own instance of it, secured with their existing access restrictions.

Usage of the public instance is bound to its [Terms of Use](https://www.open-collab.tools/tos/). Please read them carefully and use our [Discussions](https://github.com/TypeFox/open-collaboration-tools/discussions) for any questions.

## Using the Extension
This extension contributes support for the [Open Collaboration Protocol](https://open-collab.tools).
