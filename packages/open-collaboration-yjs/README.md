# Open Collaboration Yjs

Open Collaboration Tools is a collection of open source tools, libraries and extensions for live-sharing of IDE contents, designed to boost remote teamwork with open technologies. For more information about this project, please [read the announcement](https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/).

This package provides an integration of the Open Collaboration Protocol with [Yjs](https://yjs.dev). That library brings the base algorithms for working with concurrent modifications to a document.
