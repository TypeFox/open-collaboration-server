# Open Collaboration RPC

Open Collaboration Tools is a collection of open source tools, libraries and extensions for live-sharing of IDE contents, designed to boost remote teamwork with open technologies. For more information about this project, please [read the announcement](https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/).

This package provides the base types used by the Open Collaboration Protocol. This basis is inspired by [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/), as it provides a simple approach to remote procedure call (RPC). The package also includes other utilities used by various other components of the Open Collaboration Tools project.
